Lab 0 - From C structs to C++
=====

Convert the StarterLab C source code to C++, by combining data and functions.

1. Move the functions into one of the existing structures.  

2. Modify the functions to be "member" functions of the selected structure. 

3. Make all structure data private and all member functions public.

4. No global data. 

5. Convert the C function calls to C++ member function calls.

6. Use the airline0.csv file to test your application.  

7. You may make adjustment to the functions as necessary.
